Program is designed for data from the Global Historical Climatology Network and specifically, data from the Gainsville National Weather Service station. PSV files containing the data can be found here: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/oa/global-historical-climatology-network/index.html#hourly/access/by-station/. 
The Gainesville National Weather Service station can be found by searching for station number "USW00012816". Download the psv file into the same folder as the program and run the program. 

The program outputs the time it takes to read the data, the time for heap sort, and the time for merge sort.
